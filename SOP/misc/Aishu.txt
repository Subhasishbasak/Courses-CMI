Aishwarya and I went to the same college (CMI) for our post-graduation studies. As a friend she is extremely helpful, kind and very enthusiastic. She is a motivated learner and her knowledge in mathematics, more specifically in Linear Algebra is very extensive. She is creative, smart, has excellent communication skills, and is willing to help when you need it. Iâ€™m sure she will be a great asset to any team she joins.
