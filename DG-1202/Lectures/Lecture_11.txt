If all edge weights are distinct then there is a unique MCST. 
Proof: If e1 < e2 ... eN-1 = T1 and f1 < f2 < ... < fN-1 = T2 
are two such trees. Pick least i such that ei =/= fi.  WLOG assume
ei < fi. Then add ei to T2. Resulting graph has unique cycle. This
cycle MUST contain an edge from fi+1 ... fN-1 (Why?). Remove any
such edge to get T2' which has lower weight. But this contradicts
the fact that T1 and T2 are MCSTs.
