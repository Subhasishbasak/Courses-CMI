*  Why is Huffman's codes optimal even among all Uniquely Decodable Codes?

a) Entropy.

b) ABP of any Uniquely Decodable Code >= H(S) (assuming kraft-mcmillan)

c) Prove that there is a prefix code with ABP <= H(S) + 1 using the "converse"
of kraft inequality.

d) prove converse of kraft inequality

e) Prove kraft-mcmillan inequality

* BWT Transform. 

  LF Map and Invertibility. Invertibility is therefore efficient.
  What about forward?

  Suffix Arrays. Assuming efficient construction of suffix arrays show
  how to obtain BWT.
