Space complexity of Bellman-Ford Algorithm
------------------------------------------

Even though the recurrence for BF algorithm is 2 dimensional, observe
that a) we only need the last column for the final answer b) each column
depends only on the previous columns. So, it suffices to maintain just
2 columns at each point in the execution of the algorithm. This will 
result in a O(V) space and O(VE) time algorithm.
